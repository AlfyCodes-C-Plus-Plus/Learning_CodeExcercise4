# Coding Exercise 4

In this exercise you will write code that creates a profile for a new employee at a company.

You must declare a total of THREE variables, each of a different type, to represent the employee's name, age, and hourly_wage.

age should be an int
hourly_wage should be a double, and
name should be a string

You must initialize the hourly_wage to 23.50. In order to set the values for name and age you must use cin and the extraction operator >> to allow the employee to enter their name and age in that order separated by a single space.

You do not have to provide any output statements. Our Testing code will automatically supply the name and age values to test your code.
